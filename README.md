# Pawlendar - Final Year Project

## Introduction
According to the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association), pet ownership has 
increased by more than 50% during the pandemic. Unfortunately, many new pet owners are 
first time owners who have not done enough research on pet care and are now struggling to 
meet their pet's needs. I have also faced many challenges as a multi-species pet owner with my 
animals. Veterinary visits, habitat maintenance, food quantities, and pet exercise contribute to 
owners' hectic schedules, eventually leading to stress and anxiety. Pawlendar is a stress-free 
web application that is simple, user-friendly and has vast potential to grow and expand in the 
future

## Goal of Pawlendar
Pawlendar aims to link struggling pet owners with more experienced owners based on the 
similarity between pets and an efficient routine. It enables pet owners to save and track 
information and events related to their pets and share their knowledge with others. Today, to 
keep information organized and obtain trustworthy information, pet owners rely on binders, 
pet diaries, mobile applications, regular visits to the veterinarian, calendars, and to-do lists. 
This application intends to bring together to-do lists and pet diaries into a single, secure, and 
easy to use platform. As a result, beginner pet owners will eventually become experts.

## Business Case
My project is focused on the subject of pet care. In 2016 the worldwide research firm GfK 
conducted an international online study in 22 countries and found that more than half of the 
world's population has a pet. Furthermore, exotic pet ownership has risen dramatically in recent 
years. The biggest obstacle pet owners face is time management, which hugely impacts their 
daily lives. To survive, each animal has its own set of requirements. Suppose pet owners do 
not have a plan in place, these duties and obligations, financial and time commitment, may 
become highly demanding and overwhelming. 

## Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
Backend: Java
Database: MySQL
Server: Apache Tomcat
Project created in Eclipse

I chose these technologies because they are the languages and tools that I am most familiar 
with. I have done HTML, CSS, JAVA and MySQL since my first year in college, and I feel
confident in understanding how to implement and use them. During my internship, I also had 
the opportunity to practice and expand my HTML and CSS knowledge by learning about 
Bootstrap.
